    "Your task is to implement parts of the Decision Tree Classification algorithm from scratch (i.e., without importing any libraries or packages for decision trees). A decision tree is a supervised learning model used for classification tasks and is comprised of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the Dataset: Create possible splits for each feature of the dataset. For each split, separate the data into two groups based on the feature's threshold value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the Split Metric: For each split, calculate an evaluation metric such as Gini Impurity to determine the best split. Gini Impurity measures how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly labeled, aiming to create pure groups. A Gini Impurity of 0 represents perfect purity, while higher values indicate more mixed groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Build the Tree Recursively: Use a recursive function to create nodes, splitting the data until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth of tree, minimum number of samples, or no more possible splits).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Classify New Data: Use the resulting decision tree to classify a new data point based on the feature values and decision rules at each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given a 2D array of float values, train_data, as training data, where each subarray represents a unique sample. The last element in each subarray represents the true class label (e.g., 0 or 1). You will also be given test_data, which you need to classify using the decision tree you build."
